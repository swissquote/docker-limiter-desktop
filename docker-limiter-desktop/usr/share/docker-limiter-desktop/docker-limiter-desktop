# /etc/default/desktop-docker-limiter

# IMPORTANT: Modifying the configurations in this file will automatically trigger
# a restart of the Docker daemon to apply the new resource limits. Ensure that such
# a restart is safe in your environment to prevent disruptions to running containers.

# This configuration file is used to define the maximum percentage of system resources
# that can be utilized by Docker containers when using the Desktop-Docker-Limiter utility.

# MAX_MEMORY: The maximum percentage of total system memory that can be allocated
# across all Docker containers. Expressed as an integer percentage (0-100).
# Example: MAX_MEMORY=90 means Docker containers can use up to 90% of total system memory.
MAX_MEMORY=90

# MAX_CPU: The maximum percentage of total CPU resources that can be allocated
# across all Docker containers. Expressed as an integer percentage (0-100).
# Example: MAX_CPU=90 means Docker containers can use up to 90% of total CPU resources.
MAX_CPU=90
